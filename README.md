# Shipping Token
Project 3

## A blockchain based platform for secure booking, tracking and management of freight shipments across the globe 
- Based on the Ethereum network 
- Use of smart contracts

Goal: 
Track shipments around the world  from point A to point B by making an NFT for each shipment. 

# Background

Problem:  
We needed a cryptographically secure way to track shipment logistics and verify shipment integrity along all points of supply chain 

Our solution:  
We used an NFT token to represent a shipment and multiple wallets representing logistic / supply chain checkpoints. 

Using an NFT token to represent a shipment and multiple wallets representing logistic / supply chain checkpoints is an innovative new way to solve shipping and supply chain logistics tracking. Instead of keeping track of shipments in a centralized database or spreadsheet, we propose using NFTs and crypto wallets on a private network as a combination shipping documentation AND representational model of the supply chain network. An NFT will be transferred between wallets representing different supply chain checkpoints that model the actual physical shipping network, along with documentation for the shipmentâ€™s contents and other metadata, for instance tamperproofing. Built on a private network rather than the public Eth network to eliminate gas fees, the NFT/Checkpoint Wallet system is an inexpensive, secure, and elegant  solution for tracking shipping logistics.

# Tools
1. Solidity - Smart Contracts
2. Ganache [Blockchain Simulator - Alternatively use actual Eth live testnet]
3. Streamlit
4. Web Browser
5. Metamask 
6. Remix
8. ERC271

# Key Assumptions
1. A real system like this would require use of smart sensors and GPS devices on the shipment. For this project we will not have the time and the financial resources required to implement the tracking of location and condition of goods during transit

2. The insurance provider is the 3rd party verifier 


# Next Steps
If we had the $$$$$$$$$$$$ 

1. Hire lots of engineers
2. Put monitoring systems in place
3. Create company roadmap
4. Change the shipment tracking industry for good
